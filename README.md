# Stochastic-dynamical-systems
This python library contains functions that helps compute the rate at which perturbations in the populations of different states of dynamical system whether deterministic or stochastic evolves with time. Specifically, it computes if the perturbation results in the system moving towards or away from the initial distribution and the rate at which this occurs.
